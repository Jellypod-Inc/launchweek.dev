**key takeaways**

Some learnings from this week:
- We define launch weeks as a week of announcing new features. It doesn't _have to_ last 5 days, though. Take Dub. Dub's launch week lasted 3 days.
- For most companies, Day 1 was the most impactful in terms of social engagement. Dub absolutely crushed it when announcing Dub Conversions (143.7K impressions).
- Related: Pull in customers and partners as much as possible. In the previous example, Dub may have reached this level of engagement because it featured partners like Stripe, Clerk, and Supabase.
